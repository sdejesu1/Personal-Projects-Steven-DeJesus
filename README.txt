As far as instructions go, for the user, it is fairly simple.
Follow the inputs the project gives you, and you'll have the choice to
enter your name, choose whether you want to play, or quit. It is recommmended
that you download final_hangman_words.txt first, since you need that to
play the game, since the program creates a list of words by reading that file.
When you download that file, make sure it is in the same folder as this script
to avoid any errors.

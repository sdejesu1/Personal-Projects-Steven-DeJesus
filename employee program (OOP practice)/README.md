In this folder are 2 files, employee.java and setEmployee.java, which serve as practice for a newly learned topic, object oriented programming. Employee.java is where the class of employee is created, with four private fields of name, id, department, and position, a few constructors which cover the initialization of all fields, two fields, or no fields, along with set methods, which are void and only serve to initialize the fields, and get methods, which only serve to return the values of the fields.

In setEmployee.java, I set the fields to example values from the textbook by creating objects and initializing them at the same time, then at runtime, I print out a table of the employee names and their values by printing formatting their titles and values, using the get methods to return and print their values.
